The following specifies the game plan for creating a simple telemetry and command
program for interfacing with hardware. I will strive for a simple interface that gets a full
command and telemetry system up and running as fast as possible.

Requirements:
- Way to specify telemetry packets. Must be able to support multiple packets, with each
packet defined as a list of parameters with lengths defined. Offsets will be computed internally.

- Way to specify commands, which consists of a command identifier and a list of parameters.
Needs the ability to have a command type identifier as well. No nesting beyond that.

- A user overridable receive function. This function must return a list form of the received
telemetry packet. Default will support serial and tcp

- A user overridable send function. The user is responsible for defining header and crc
information. Default will support serial and tcp.


Spitballing area:
Telemetry defined by csv.
Each physical packet can be defined by a different file.
Base format:
NAME, DATALENGTH
optional:
SUBGROUP, DATATYPE, UNITS, LOW ERROR, LOW WARNING, HIGH WARNING, HIGH ERROR, CONVERSION

COMMANDS
NAME, COMMAND_ID,
NAME, COMMAND_ID, PARAM, LENGTH
optional:
SUBGROUP, DATATYPE, UNITS, HIGH LIMIT, LOW LIMIT, CONVERSION


RANDOM:
Gonna be a pain to parse user input and flow through conversion.
